    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to make the traditional taste of African food known to the entire universe. Since moving
        to the US, rexburg to be precise, one thing that I have miss the most is having to eat typical Nigeria dish
    and Africa dish in general. There are some day's I crave so much for it, but it's hard to source for the ingredient.
    so this site we be a platfrom whereby local cook can create a mobile restaurant. This simply means, if I 
    make traditional africa food, I can register my brand on the site, and whoever is craving for a particular
    Africa dish, can easily login and make a search and order and it will be delivered.  </p>
